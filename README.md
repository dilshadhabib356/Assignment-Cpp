### Environment Details:
- **Operating System:** Windows 11 (64-bit)
- **Compiler:** MSVC 2022 (vc143)
- **C++ Standard:** C++ 17

### Project Structure:
This assignment is organized with a separate solution (`*.sln`) file for every question. Each solution is contained within its individual folder.

For the **6th Chatroom Question**, there are two separate solution files within the "Question 6" folder:
- **Client:** Contains the solution for the chatroom client.
- **Server:** Contains the solution for the chatroom server.

It is imperative to note that both the client and server should be running for a successful chatroom operation.

### Opening the Solutions:
To review or run any of the questions, navigate to the corresponding folder and open the solution (`*.sln`) file using Visual Studio. It's recommended to use an updated version of Visual Studio to ensure compatibility and smooth operation.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before attempting to compile and run any solution.
- The assignment has been designed for ease of navigation. If issues arise, first ensure your Visual Studio is up-to-date and properly configured.
- Each solution, unless otherwise specified, is self-contained and should be run independently.
